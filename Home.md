EarthDiver is an implementation of a recommended REST API for use in the DPN Federated network of Nodes.  It serves as an example of how a common REST API could be implemented for a DPN First Node.  

Documentation on the API will contain two sections

*DPN REST API* will document endpoints, calls and returns that MUST be implemented by any node to honor the DPN REST API contract.  The common portion of the API is purposefully kept to a minimum so as to provide a simple common later that grants implementations the flexibility to address localized or optional features as best suites them.

*EarthDiver API* will cover other api endpoints, calls or returns that are part of the localized implementation and workflows surrounding using EarthDiver as your API server if you so choose.

See Pages on specific topics or API calls for more information.
