EarthDiver is an implementation of a recommended REST API for use in the DPN Federated network of Nodes.  It serves as an example of how a common REST API could be implemented for a DPN First Node.  

Documentation of the API will designate specific as either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL

*EXTERNAL* endpoints MUST be implemented as documented by any node to honor the DPN REST API contract.  The common portion of the API is purposefully kept to a minimum so as to provide a simple common later that grants implementations the flexibility to address localized or optional features as best suites them.

*INTERNAL* endpoints will cover optional api endpoints, calls or returns that are part of the localized implementation and workflows surrounding using EarthDiver as your API server if you so choose.
