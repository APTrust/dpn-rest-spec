### DPN Format Date Time

All times are UTC.  DPN does not synchronize clocks, but instead expects clocks to be reasonably accurate within a few seconds.  DPN nodes must not rely on other nodes' clocks being accurate.  

The format is as follows:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

Example:
    
    2015-03-13T15:40:05Z

### Fixity Algorithms

### Protocols

    Rsync : "rsync"

### Storage Regions
